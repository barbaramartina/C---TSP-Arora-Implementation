C++ TSP-Arora Implementation
============================

A novel implementation of the solution proposed by [Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/) for the Travelling Salesman Problem.
During one of my university courses I needed to choose one topic as a final project to pass the course, I went for the back them hardest one, which brought me literally a lot of tears to implement because it was very hard and back them in 2008 there was no one in the world who have done what me and my professor wanted to: a concrete public source implementation of Arora's proposed algorithm.

This was a very challenging and full of learnings journey, which led to the publication of the research and implementation we did in 2 international Computer Sciences publications (see my repository **Publications** for more details). 

At the end of the road I was extremely satisfied that the dedication I put into this project was bringing so many rewards.

This repository contains the code I did back them as an student, and is my goal to make it available to anyone who dare to do another Arora's implementation.
